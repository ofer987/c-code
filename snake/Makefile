# products, object files, make dependencies, assembler

# The choice of the compiler. Commonly available on POSIX systems are
# compilers called clang, gcc, icc or c99. Try them in this order if
# the following does not work for you.
#
# Here we used a "wrapper" for gcc that comes with the "musl" C
# library. This has the advatage to provide full support for C11
# threads that we need for the "experience" level. On some Linux
# distributions musl is available as packages 'musl', 'musl-dev',
# 'musl-tools'. Other Linux distributions such as Alpine directly ship
# with musl as their C library.
# CC ?= /usr/local/musl/bin/musl-gcc
CC = clang
# CC = gcc-14
#CC = icc
#CC = c99

# A collection of typical flags on a Linux box with gcc or clang

# First a choice of a C standard to which your code is conforming. The
# following should be the default for a recent compiler (2023). Other
# options could be -std=c11 or -std=gnu11.
STD = -std=c2x

# Warning options. It is important that the compiler gives you all
# that he knows.
WAR = -Wall -Wattributes -lform -lncurses

# Optimization options. The ones here are my favorite, maximal
# optimization for the machine on which we are compiling and maximal
# separation of functions and data into different sections.
OPT ?= -O3 -march=native -fdata-sections -ffunction-sections

# For the gcc and friends the addition of this flag produces a make
# dependency file with suffix .d
DEP = -MD

CFLAGS = ${SILENT} ${OPT} ${WAR} ${STD} ${INC} ${DEP}

# The linker flags. Here this corresponds to eliminate all of the
# collected sections that are finally not needed in the executable.
# LDFLAGS = -Wl,--gc-sections
# in the link step we need our own library
LDLIBS = -L. -lmodernC
# sometime we will need the "math" library and also "real time"
LDLIBS += -lm -lrt
